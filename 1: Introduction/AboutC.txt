C PROPERTIES
    - Allows the most precise control of input and output 
    - C is more terse than Fortran or Pascal but more verbose
    than modern programming languages (esp. Python)
    - Requires HIGH PRECISION with memory allocation

C FUNCTIONS
    - Values stored in variables 
    - Programs are structured by defining and calling functions
    - Program flow controlled by    
        > Loops
        > If statements
        > Function Calls
    - Input and Output can be directed to the terminal or to files 
    - Uses mechanisms like pointers (indirect addressing) for memory allocation 

C NUANCES
    - Poor use of pointers will lead to errors that are EXTREMELY HARD TO TRACE
