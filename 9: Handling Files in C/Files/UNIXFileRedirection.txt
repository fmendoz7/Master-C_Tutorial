UNIX allows "redirection", allowing a program to access a single input file and single output file very easily 

Program reads from keyboard and writes to terminal screen as normal 

> Format: file_name < input_file_name 
> Ex: To run prog1 but read data from infile instead of keyboard
    prog1 < infile 

> Ex: To redirect output of prog1 to outfile instead of screen  
    prog1 > outfile 

> Ex: Can also combine both operations in one line 
    prog1 < infile > outfile 

Redirection is not able to handle or access input/output for multiple files
